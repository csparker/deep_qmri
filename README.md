# Deep Learning of qMRI parameters - CMIC Hackathon 2022

In a nutshell, the project aims to make deep learning of quantitative parameters from MRI more accurate, by correctly handling the distribution of MRI image noise. 

This repo provides **resources** to help Hackers undertake the project and will also host the **outputs** of the project.

Hacker's should start off by checking out the [Hackers Guide](Hackers_Guide.md)!

Once the project is complete, a tutorial demonstrating the new approach will be hosted [here](deep_qmri_rician.ipynb).

The tutorial we will create can extend the tutorial for the original unsupervised approach, which can be found [here](deep_qmri_leastsquares_demo.ipynb) (Jupyter notebook) or [here](deep_qmri_leastsquares_demo.py) (Python code)
