# Deep Learning of qMRI parameters - CMIC Hackathon 2022

This repository contains guides, demo's and other resources to aid Hackers working on the project 'Deep learning of qMRI parameters'.

The project aims to make deep learning of qMRI more accurate by incorporating a loss function that correctly handles image noise.

Once complete, we will demonstrate a tutorial for the approach here.

Hacker's can start by looking at the Hackers Guide!
