# Deep Learning of qMRI parameters - CMIC Hackathon 2022

In a nutshell, the project aims to make deep learning of quantitative parameters from MRI more accurate. We aim to acheive this by correctly handling the distribution of MRI image noise when evaluating the loss function. 

The repository provides some useful **resources** to help Hackers undertake the project. It will also host the **outputs** of the project.

Hacker's should start off by checking out the [Hackers Guide](Hackers_Guide.md)!

Once complete, a tutorial demonstrating the new approach can be hosted [here](deep_qmri_rician.ipynb).

Our tutorial can extend the one for the original unsupervised approach, which can be found in this repository, [here](deep_qmri_leastsquares_demo.ipynb) (Jupyter notebook) or [here](deep_qmri_leastsquares_demo.py) (Python code)
