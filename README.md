# Deep Learning of qMRI parameters - CMIC Hackathon 2022

In a nutshell, the project aims to make deep learning of quantitative parameters from MRI more accurate, by correctly handling the shape MRI image noise. 

This repo was created to provide a resource to help Hackers undertake the project and to host outputs of the project.

Hacker's should start off by checking out the [Hackers Guide](Hackers_Guide.md)!

Once complete, a tutorial demonstrating the new approach will be found [here](deep_qmri_rician.ipynb).
