# Rician likelihood loss function for quantitative MRI with deep learning

This repository contains a [walkthrough](Walkthrough/Walkthrough_Rician_Loss.ipynb) and example [implementations](Implementations) of the Rician likelihood loss function for self-supervised quantitative MRI (qMRI) as described in Parker et al (2023) [1]. 

The walkthrough goes through a simple example of applying the Rician loss function for self-supervised qMRI. The example implementations provide syntax to specify and call the Rician loss function in [PyTorch](Implementations/Rician_Loss_PyTorch.ipynb), [TensorFlow](Implementations/Rician_Loss_PyTorch.ipynb) and [Keras](Implementations/Rician_Loss_PyTorch.ipynb).

Note that the walkthrough is an adaptation of the demo hosted at https://github.com/sebbarb/deep_ivim - many thanks to the authors for making their demo code easy to use and openly available.
