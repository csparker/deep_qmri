# Deep Learning of qMRI parameters - CMIC Hackathon 2022

Our project aims to make deep learning of quantitative parameters from MRI more accurate. We will do this by incorporating a loss function that correctly handles the shape of the noise in MRI images. We will provide a tutorial demonstrating the approach here.

Aside from the demonstration, this repository also contains guides, demo's and other resources to aid Hackers working on the project. Hacker's should start off by checking out the Hackers Guide!
