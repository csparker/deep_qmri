# Deep Learning of qMRI parameters - CMIC Hackathon 2022

In a nutshell, the project aims to make deep learning of quantitative parameters from MRI more accurate, by correctly handling the distribution of MRI image noise. 

This repo provides resources to help Hackers undertake the project and will also host the outputs of the project.

Hacker's should start off by checking out the [Hackers Guide](Hackers_Guide.md)!

Once complete, a tutorial demonstrating the new approach will be found [here](deep_qmri_rician.ipynb).
